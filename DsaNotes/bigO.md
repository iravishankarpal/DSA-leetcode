# type of orders of growth 
on x axis there is input 
on y axis there is time

if we will kee increment of input what will be the perfomance of algo with respect to itme 

### constant  O(1)
    its consider to be the best 
    all the arthematic operations 
    a = [1,2,..., 1000]
    a[100] = 95 
    its a linear operation because array a has memory location and to find local math formula
    address + [byte to store data * postion no]
    which is eg. 0000124 + ( 4 * 100)
    O(1)
    
### logrithemic O(log(n))
    if input is Multiplying out is adding 
    eg binary search 
    O(log(n))

### liner O(n)
    if input is 1 then output is 2 
    if input is 2 then output is 3 
    if input is 3 then output is 4 
    if input is 4 then output is 5 
    eg liner search  
    O(n) 
     
### nlogn O(nlog(n))
    if n log n  sorting  and searching 
    mearge search and quick search    
    O(nlog(n))

### quadratic 
    if input is adding output is multiplying 
    O(n ^ 2)
    
### exponential
    not seen very bad
    O(2 ^ n)
