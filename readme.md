# DSA and LeetCode notes, daily problem solving

Hi, This is a repo to store my notes for DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)
and LeetCode notes. My goal is to solve one problem on LeetCode everyday.

I will be using Python to solve the problems.

I will be updating this repo regularly, so you can follow along and see how my
solutions are improving.

Please feel free to use this repo to track your own progress, or learn from my
approach.

If you have any suggestions or see any errors, please create an issue or make a
pull request!
